# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Window > Full Screen (Cmd+M): the active session's window fills the whole screen below the menu bar, with no title bar, and the terminal grid grows to fit (about 82x27 on a 512x342 Mac Plus with Monaco 9). Choosing it again restores the normal window where it was. The server is told the new size, so full-screen programs reflow (both)

## [1.10.2] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed
- Crash on Cmd+Q or closing the last window from the keyboard: the event loop dereferenced the active session after menu dispatch had destroyed it, corrupting low memory before an address error (both)
- Preferences migration corrupted all pre-v14 prefs files: the version overlays used current struct layouts instead of the historical on-disk ones, so upgrading from v1.5.x–v1.8.x garbled bookmarks, fonts, DNS server, and username. Migration rewritten with frozen per-era layouts and covered by a native test suite (tests/migration_test.c); v8-era DNS server settings are now recovered instead of reset (both)
- Session log header/footer could write stack memory into the log file when the hostname was long (both, logging builds)
- `ESC H` (tab set) left the escape parser in a stuck state, swallowing the next character — corrupted output after terminfo reset strings (both)
- Insert mode (CSI 4h) was ignored for plain ASCII text, overwriting instead of shifting the line (both)
- Truecolor SGR sequences with saturated colors (e.g. pure red) rendered gray: 16-bit overflow in the 256-color distance mapping (color builds on System 7)
- DNS-over-TCP fallback failed on responses spanning multiple TCP segments — now reads until the full message arrives (both)
- Multi-line paste sent bare CR line endings; now sends NVT-standard CR LF so pastes work on strict/line-mode servers (both, clipboard builds)
- Cmd+1–Cmd+0 window-switch shortcuts were shadowed by an F-key mapping while connected; the F-key aliases are removed (function keys still work via real F1–F12) and Cmd+digit now switches sessions as the Window menu advertises (both)
- Find in Scrollback never matched non-ASCII characters (signed-char comparison) (both)
- 8-bit C1 OSC/CSI introducers (0x9D/0x9B) initialized parser state differently than their ESC-sequence equivalents (both)
- Print jobs no longer call PrCloseDoc after a failed PrOpenDoc, which could fault in the printer driver (both, printing builds)
- Finger fetches froze the UI for up to 10 seconds on slow servers; timeout reduced to 3 seconds (both, finger builds)
- Finger LF→CRLF conversion produced a stray CR when a server's CR LF spanned two network reads (both, finger builds)
- Preferences saves now report disk errors (full/locked disk) instead of silently losing all settings, and flush the volume after writing (both)
- MacTCP connection-state constant misnamed TIME_WAIT renamed to CLOSE_WAIT (internal, no behavior change)

### Changed
- Window menu no longer fully rebuilds on every remote title change — only the affected item's text updates, avoiding Menu Manager thrash during OSC-title output floods (both)
- Session logging batches file writes (flush on half-full buffer, ~1 s elapsed, stop, or disconnect) instead of one synchronous write per network chunk — reduces stalls when logging to slow media (both, logging builds)
- Post-keystroke echo poll is skipped when more than one session is open, so typing in one window no longer starves the others (both)
- Theme import writes preferences to disk once instead of twice (color builds)
- Public project links (README, About dialog, About Flynn document) now point to the GitHub mirror at https://github.com/ecliptik/flynn instead of Codeberg; issues are tracked on GitHub. Codeberg release publishing removed from `release.sh` (both)

## [1.10.1] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- Stuffit 1.5.1 archives (`.sit`) now generated as a distribution artifact alongside `.dsk` and `.hqx`, containing Flynn and About Flynn. Expand with StuffIt Expander on the Mac.

### Fixed
- Cross-application clipboard broken under System 6 MultiFinder: the `app4Evt` handler ignored `convertClipboardFlag`, so Flynn never called `LoadScrap`/`UnloadScrap` on suspend/resume. Text copied in other apps was invisible to Flynn's paste and Show Clipboard, and text copied in Flynn never reached other apps.
- MacBinary headers for `Flynn.bin` now carry the build's creation/modification date instead of the epoch, so Finder no longer shows deployed copies as "Fri Jan 1 1904".

## [1.10.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- HIG-appropriate modal dialogs: dBoxProc on System 6, movableDBoxProc on System 7 (draggable title bar)
- All modal dialogs centered on screen (horizontal center, upper-third vertical)
- Background window redraw when dragging movable modals on System 7
- Edit Favorite dialog: redesigned with title bar (noGrowDocProc), split Font/Size popups, Theme/Backspace/Echo settings per favorite
- Manage Favorites dialog: title bar added for consistency (noGrowDocProc)
- Status bar shows Backspace (BS/DEL) and Local Echo (Echo On/Off) indicators
- Theme engine: 9 built-in themes (Light, Dark, Solarized Light/Dark, Tokyo Light/Dark, Green Screen, Classic, Platinum) with 4 optional themes (Dracula, Monokai, Nord, Gruvbox)
- Per-window settings: theme, terminal type, backspace, and local echo are independent per session
- Per-bookmark theme/backspace/local echo persistence (saved alongside existing per-bookmark font/terminal type)
- New sessions inherit active session's theme and input settings (falls back to prefs on first launch)
- Theme submenu under Options menu on color systems (System 7+), simple Dark Mode On/Off toggle on mono (System 6)
- docs/THEMES.md: developer guide for creating custom themes
- Session logging (Cmd+L): continuous output logging to text file with ANSI escape sequence filtering, CR deduplication, and sensitive data warning in log header
- Print support (Cmd+P): Page Setup and Print via Printing Manager with paginated output, Geneva 9pt header/footer, Monaco 9pt terminal content, and ImageWriter spool printing
- Telnet NOP keep-alive: sends IAC NOP after 120 seconds idle to prevent NAT/firewall drops
- Reconnect (Cmd+R): reconnect to same host after disconnect, also available in File menu
- Reconnect button on disconnect alert: one-click reconnect when remote host closes connection
- Reset Terminal in Control menu: clears screen and resets parser state without disconnecting
- Clear Scrollback in Edit menu: frees scrollback buffer for long sessions
- Find in Scrollback (Cmd+F) with Find Again (Cmd+G): search backward through terminal content
- Show Clipboard viewer window in Edit menu: TextEdit display with scrollbars, resize support
- GURL Apple Event handler: System 7 browsers can hand off telnet:// URLs to Flynn
- Window position saved to preferences and restored on next launch

### Fixed
- Multi-session status bar toggle applied wrong theme: resize loop loaded per-session font but not per-session theme, so all windows were redrawn with the active session's theme (System 7 color only)
- Grow box (size box) not redrawn on window activate/deactivate: DrawGrowIcon was missing from handle_activate, so cascaded windows whose grow box was never obscured showed a stale/empty grow box after switching (both mono and color)
- Window port backColor not synced with theme on session switch: PaintBehind filled exposed regions with stale white/black instead of the session's theme background (System 7 color only)
- Status bar showed global terminal type instead of per-session type: all sessions displayed prefs.terminal_type rather than their own negotiated ttype
- Out of memory on 3rd session with color themes: SIZE resource calculation did not account for per-session CellColor arrays or the shared GWorld offscreen buffer; color builds now floor at 1024KB preferred partition (System 6 mono builds unaffected)
- Color selection not highlighting empty cells beyond text: selected runs of plain spaces were skipped in the color rendering path, causing multi-row selections to only highlight characters (System 7 only; mono unaffected)
- Selection highlighting not following content during scroll: selection coordinates were screen-relative but not adjusted when scroll_offset changed, so the highlight stayed in place while content scrolled underneath (both mono and color)
- Light theme white-on-white after theme switch: cursor_blink left themed ForeColor (white from Dark) in window port, corrupting CopyBits color mapping; reset port colors before CopyBits and restore after cursor_blink
- Stale pixels on surviving window after multi-session close: DisposeWindow only updates previously-obscured region; added InvalRect on full portRect in session_destroy_and_fixup
- Out of memory on repeated theme switching: GWorld free/realloc cycle (~137KB) fragmented heap; added term_ui_repaint_offscreen() that invalidates content without freeing buffers
- drain_one() always returned 0 (no data): session_process_data zeroed read_len before the return-value check; track had_data separately
- favorites_add() sentinel bug: bm_theme_id/bm_backspace_bs/bm_local_echo initialized to 0 (wrong value) instead of -1 (use global default) via memset; now captures actual session values
- Backspace popup in Edit Favorite: `^H` and `^?` were parsed as Menu Manager metacharacters by AppendMenu, graying out items; fixed with SetMenuItemText
- Status bar not updating on Backspace/Local Echo toggle from Options menu
- Color desync: reverted pointer-rotation scroll to memmove (fixes gray/wrong ANSI colors after scroll on System 7)
- Dark theme white holes: skip color GWorld for non-white-bg themes, draw directly to window (avoids Window Manager BeginUpdate white fill)
- Disconnect color preservation: snap_color buffer saves/restores CellColor data alongside TermCell content
- Theme bleed-through on window close: all destroy paths use session_destroy_and_fixup to restore surviving session's theme
- Per-session theme globals swapped in idle loop, update handler, and activate handler
- Drawing code uses theme_is_dark() instead of prefs.dark_mode for per-session correctness
- Cursor blink no longer fires during scrollback view (caused XOR artifact over scrollback content)
- DNS response parser signed short overflow on crafted RDLEN values
- OSC parameter accumulation signed short overflow (guard tightened)
- Window title from OSC 0/2 now strips control characters (bytes < 0x20)
- Window resize on font change used wrong status bar height calculation
- Grow box and scrollbar column not redrawn after window resize snap-to-grid
- Cell width uses CharWidth('M') instead of widMax (fixes spacing with scaled bitmap fonts)
- Status bar color cache invalidation after GWorld rendering on System 7
- Zero-width selection no longer renders inverted cell on single click
- Clicks in disconnected terminal sessions ignored (prevents stale color artifacts)

### Changed
- Scroll rendering reverted to memmove (pointer rotation caused color desync on System 7; mono unaffected)
- Smoother bulk output: smaller draw batches, shorter jump scroll deadline, reduced drain loop cap
- Font and Size split into separate submenus (matching Geomys HIG)
- New fonts: New York (System 6+), Helvetica, Times, Palatino (System 7 only, added at runtime)
- Size submenu: 9, 10, 12, 14 — any font/size combination now possible
- Options menu uses Apple HIG action verbs: "Turn Dark Mode On/Off", "Show/Hide Status Bar", "Turn Local Echo On/Off", "Switch Backspace to BS/DEL (^H/^?)"
- Removed trailing colons from all dialog labels (Connect, Favorites, DNS Server, Finger, Find)
- Edit Favorite: Host and Port on same row, all settings show resolved values (no ambiguous "Default" option)
- Favorites popup menus list current value first for Backspace and Echo
- DNS Server moved from File menu to Options menu
- Status bar always white with black text regardless of dark mode (chrome, not content)
- File menu reorganized: New, Close, Reconnect, Finger, Save, Quit
- Finger shortcut changed from Cmd+F to Cmd+I (Cmd+F now Find, matching Geomys)
- Screen row pointer table eliminates row×132 multiply on all screen accesses (+200 bytes/session)
- Color row pointer table eliminates multiply for color array access on System 7
- Glyph cache uses direct lookup table instead of linear search (O(1) vs O(49))
- Charset-is-standard cached flag reduces per-character struct reads in fast path
- Pre-computed cell height fractions eliminate divides in glyph rendering
- adjust_cursor() only called on mouse movement, not every idle tick
- Color cube RGB decomposition uses subtraction loops instead of division (no hardware divide on 68000)
- DNS resolver stack buffers made static (saves ~1.5KB stack)
- Deduplicated show_ttype_popup between connect and bookmark edit dialogs
- Removed dead code: TelnetState.sb_opt, favorites_init_menu(), redundant telnet_init zeroing
- Build flag: -fomit-frame-pointer frees A6 register on 68000
- Inline TERM_DIRTY_ROW macro saves JSR/RTS overhead per dirty-row mark
- Gate cached_fg_idx invalidation on actual TextFace change (saves ~24us/trap on color systems)
- Factor drain_one()/check_keepalive() helpers in event loop (~55 lines deduped)
- Deduplicate term_put_cp437 cell-write logic via term_put_char (~25 lines removed)
- Convert snap_screen/snap_color from inline array/Ptr to Handle, sized to active dimensions (3.8KB at 80x24 vs 13.2KB at 132x50), freed immediately after disconnect restore

## [1.9.8] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- iBeam cursor when mouse is over terminal text area (arrow elsewhere)

### Fixed
- Click-and-drag text selection not highlighting or selecting wrong text
  (shadow buffer optimization was skipping rows where only selection changed)

## [1.9.7] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- Zoom box in window title bar per Apple HIG (zoomDocProc)
  - Click to toggle between user-sized window and standard 80x24 grid
  - Sets standard state to default terminal dimensions
  - Sends NAWS update to server on zoom while connected

### Changed
- Scrollbar width from 16 to 15 pixels, matching Geomys UI dimensions
- Build system: renamed macplus preset to lite, full is now default
- README: added direct download links, auto-updated in release.sh

### Fixed
- BUILD.md examples updated to reflect full as default preset
- BUILD.md: added apt-get install line for Debian/Ubuntu prerequisites

## [1.9.6] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- Finger protocol client (RFC 1288) — File > Finger... (Cmd+F)
  - Query user information on remote hosts via TCP port 79
  - Host, username, and verbose (/W) fields in Finger dialog
  - Finger forwarding: user@host@gateway auto-splits and routes correctly
  - Remembers last finger host/username across launches
  - Status bar shows "finger | [user@]host"
  - Window title includes "(finger)" suffix
  - Per-bookmark protocol selection (Telnet or Finger) in bookmark editor
  - Favorites submenu dispatches finger bookmarks correctly
- Configurable build system with 16 compile-time feature flags
  - 3 build presets: minimal (~256KB), lite (~384KB), full (~768KB)
  - Every major feature can be toggled: `--finger`, `--color`, `--glyphs`,
    `--cp437`, `--clipboard`, `--savefile`, `--bookmarks`, `--darkmode`,
    `--dblwidth`, `--altscreen`, `--offscreen`, `--statusbar`,
    `--cursorstyles`, `--tabstops`
  - Configurable sessions (1-4) and scrollback lines (0-256)
  - SIZE resource (Finder memory partition) dynamically computed from
    enabled features
  - Presets applied first, individual flags override:
    `--preset minimal --finger --bookmarks`
  - Three-layer guard pattern: CMake source exclusion, header no-op stubs,
    inline #ifdef guards (~163 guard sites across 26 files)
  - FlynnPrefs struct unchanged for cross-build prefs compatibility
- Three release editions: Flynn (full), Flynn Lite, Flynn Minimal
- Build documentation: `docs/BUILD.md` with complete flag reference,
  memory costs, presets, and examples
- Direct offscreen memory writes bypass QuickDraw traps for rendering
  (font bitmap cache, direct glyph blit, direct erase/fill)
- Shadow buffer skips unchanged rows via memcmp
- Scroll sync uses memmove instead of CopyBits
- Color GWorld offscreen buffer eliminates flicker on System 7
- Optimized scrollbar arrow scrolling: ScrollRect + offscreen memmove
  renders only 1 row per arrow click instead of full 24-row redraw

### Fixed
- Dark mode rendering bugs: white bar at window bottom, status bar
  artifacts, stale offscreen content
- Offscreen buffer reuse: clear pixel data when reusing for different
  window with same dimensions (prevented stale session content bleed)
- Scrollback ring buffer index: corrected formula for partially-filled
  buffers (was sb_head+sb_count+sb_row, now sb_head+sb_row)
- Drain loop data race: process pending TCP data before checking for
  disconnect state transition
- System 7 GWorld rendering stability and artifact fixes
- icl8/ics8 icon polarity for System 7 color displays
- 68000 address error in offscreen_fill_rect

### Changed
- Default build uses full preset: 4 sessions, 192-line scrollback, ~768KB
- Binary size: 91KB minimal, 125KB default, 130KB full
- Release script builds all 3 presets and uploads 6 artifacts per release
- FlynnPrefs v12 (finger_host, finger_user, bookmark_protocol[])
- File menu: Finger... inserted at position 2, items renumbered
- Control menu disabled for finger sessions
- Bookmark edit dialog: protocol popup (Telnet/Finger), dialog enlarged
- Performance and security review: hardening, leak fixes, dead code
  removal, optimizations, and refactoring

## [1.9.5] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- Double-buffered rendering, local echo, fast key repeat, send-then-poll
  echo, 3 new emoji, glyph bitmap cache

### Fixed
- Bookmark list overflow, ScrollRect dark mode flash, ScrollRect dirty
  flag misalignment, stale offscreen on session destroy, multi-window
  cross-session blit

### Changed
- 12 performance improvements (ScrollRect 10x, partial CopyBits 95%,
  jump scrolling 7-10x, batched TCP reads, double-DrawText bold 14.5x,
  mono path split, glyph run merging, etc.), plus offscreen-based update
  events/dark mode/resize, prefs v10
- Build size: ~119KB (up from ~103KB, offscreen buffer and glyph cache)
- Memory: ~90KB/session mono, ~110KB/session color

## [1.9.4] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- Option+Space (Ctrl-Space) not recognized: vkey_to_base table was 48
  entries, Space at vkey 0x31 (49) fell outside it. Extended table to
  include Space, enabling Ctrl-Space (0x00) for tmux prefix and similar
- Option+/ (Ctrl-/) not recognized: added '/' to vkey_to_base table
  with special case since '/' & 0x1F produces wrong value (0x0F instead
  of 0x1F)
- ANSI-BBS disconnect losing goodbye screen: telnet_init() zeroed the
  session's preferred_ttype before the snapshot restore check, so
  bookmark-specific ANSI-BBS sessions saw the global pref (e.g. xterm)
  and incorrectly restored the pre-clear snapshot. Now saves the
  session's terminal type before reset

## [1.9.3] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- 13 new Unicode glyph mappings: flower/florette dingbats (U+273E-2741),
  snowflake (U+2744), sparkles (U+2728), flower emoji (🌸🌺🌼🌟💫),
  plus 2 new QuickDraw primitives (flower, snowflake)
- OSC 4 palette color query (rgb:RRRR/GGGG/BBBB replies from 256-color
  palette), OSC 10/11 default fg/bg color queries (dark_mode-aware),
  OSC 12/112 cursor color set/reset (no-op on monochrome XOR cursor)
- Hierarchical submenus: Options menu now uses Font and Terminal Type
  submenus (20 items → 5), fixing menu scrolling off-screen on Mac Plus.
  File menu uses Favorites submenu for bookmark entries
- Backspace mode toggle: DEL (0x7F) default for xterm/VT220, BS (0x08)
  for ANSI-BBS. Auto-switches when changing terminal type; manual override
  in Options menu ("Backspace Sends BS" checkmark)
- Send Ctrl-H and Send Ctrl-X items in Control menu
- Prefs v8→v9 migration for backspace_bs field

### Fixed
- Dark mode shutter effect on monochrome: EraseRect (white) → draw →
  InvertRect caused visible white flash per row. Now renders directly
  with PaintRect (black bg) + srcBic/patBic (white drawing)
- BBS goodbye screen not displayed on disconnect: drain remaining TCP
  data before closing on TIME_WAIT; skip snapshot restore for ANSI-BBS
  terminal type to preserve goodbye screen
- DNS lookup failure after prefs migration: backspace_bs field was inserted
  before dns_server in the FlynnPrefs struct, shifting all subsequent fields
  by 1 byte. DNS server "1.1.1.1" became ".1.1.1" (invalid), and username
  lost its first character. Fixed validation to reject leading-dot IPs and
  reset dns_server in migration
- Backspace mode not auto-enabled when connecting with ANSI-BBS terminal
  type via bookmark or new session (only worked from Options menu)

### Changed
- Bookmarks renamed to Favorites throughout UI (menus, dialogs, labels)
- Terminal Type menu reordered: xterm, xterm-256color, VT100, VT220,
  ANSI-BBS (display order decoupled from internal storage indices)
- Connection status window widened from 240→320px, hostname truncation
  40→50 chars to accommodate longer hostnames
- Performance: hot path optimizations in terminal parser and draw routines
- Security: bounds checking on terminal response buffer flush
- Dead code removal: ~50 lines removed, unused functions and defines cleaned up
- Defensive improvements: conn_send() rejects zero-length writes, removed
  unused idle_skip field from Connection struct

## [1.9.2] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- CP437/ANSI-BBS terminal emulation for bulletin board systems
  - Full 256-entry CP437 lookup table mapping each byte to ASCII, Mac Roman,
    or QuickDraw glyph rendering
  - cp437_mode bypasses UTF-8 decoder for raw byte rendering, essential for
    BBS art using 0x80-0x9F range (C1 control code collision in UTF-8 mode)
  - ANSI-BBS terminal type in TTYPE negotiation, settings, preferences menu,
    and connect dialog — follows BBS community convention (ansi-bbs = CP437)
- True SGR attribute rendering
  - Italic (SGR 3) via TextFace(italic)
  - Strikethrough (SGR 9) via horizontal line at cell mid-height
  - Dim (SGR 2) halves foreground RGB on color systems
  - Blink (SGR 5/6) promotes background to bright colors (DOS-style)
- Bold-to-bright color promotion: SGR 1;30-37m promotes to bright colors
  (indices 8-15), matching standard ANSI/BBS behavior
- UTF-8 CP437 fallback for BBSes that send raw CP437 bytes despite
  xterm-256color TTYPE negotiation
- 57 new QuickDraw glyph primitives: double-line box drawing, mixed
  junctions, smileys, Greek/math symbols (160+ total primitives)
- 18 fractional block element glyphs (U+2581-U+258F, U+2594-U+2595)
- 60 sextant characters (U+1FB00-U+1FB3B) as 2x3 grid patterns
- DNS-over-TCP fallback for NAT environments
- Rendering diagnostic script (`scripts/render-test.sh`)

### Fixed
- DNS resolution through NAT: Snow's DaynaPORT rewrites UDP source IPs,
  causing Flynn to reject valid DNS responses. Removed redundant source IP
  validation (txn_id match already authenticates responses)
- Backspace sends BS (0x08) instead of DEL (0x7F) for BBS compatibility
  (Linux telnetd accepts both; BBSes universally expect BS)
- Bytes 0xF8-0xFF silently dropped by UTF-8 parser — now route to CP437
- Legacy Computing chars (U+1FB00-U+1FBFF) produced double '??' instead
  of single '?' (they are single-width, not wide)

### Changed
- Glyph count: 103 → 160+ QuickDraw primitives
- Dead code removal: 25 cases from boxdraw_to_dec() superseded by glyph
  tables, 3 cases from unicode_symbol_to_macroman(), dead block element
  fallback block (~50 lines, ~700 bytes recovered)
- Performance: eliminated double cell fetch in draw_row() (~80K cycles/redraw
  saved on 68000), replaced dark shade MULU with shift operation
- New source files: `cp437.c`, `cp437.h`

## [1.9.1] - 2026-03-10

### Changed
- Version bump to 1.9.1 (docs and build metadata only)

## [1.9.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- 256-color support on System 7 with Color QuickDraw
  - Full 256-color palette: 16 ANSI colors + 216 color cube + 24 grayscale
  - Truecolor (24-bit) SGR sequences downgraded to nearest 256-color match
  - Palette Manager rendering via PmForeColor/PmBackColor for performance
  - Color windows with NewCWindow/NewPalette on System 7, standard NewWindow on System 6
  - Runtime detection via SysEnvirons() hasColorQD — zero impact on System 6
  - Per-cell foreground and background colors stored in CellColor arrays
  - ATTR_HAS_COLOR (bit 6) flag for fast skip of default-colored cells
  - Color-aware dark mode: swaps default fg/bg, skips InvertRect on color systems
  - New source files: `color.c`, `color.h`
  - Memory: +52KB per session on System 7 color, zero on System 6 monochrome
- 38 new QuickDraw primitive glyphs (103 total, up from 65):
  - Outline triangles: △ ▽ ▷ ◁ (U+25B3, U+25BD, U+25B7, U+25C1)
  - Small filled triangles: ▸ ◂ (U+25B8, U+25C2)
  - Diamonds: ◆ ◇ (U+25C6, U+25C7)
  - Half-circle variants: ◐ ◑ ◒ ◓ (U+25D0-U+25D3)
  - Fisheye circle: ◉ (U+25C9)
  - Six-pointed star: ✶ (U+2736)
  - Circled operators: ⊙ ⊕ ⊖ ⊗ (U+2299, U+2295-U+2297)
  - Superscript digits: ⁰¹²³⁴⁵⁶⁷⁸⁹ (U+2070, U+00B9, U+00B2, U+00B3, U+2074-U+2079)
  - Subscript digits: ₀₁₂₃₄₅₆₇₈₉ (U+2080-U+2089)
  - Superscripts/subscripts rendered at 60% font size with scaled positioning

### Fixed
- Terminal type not saved between sessions — Connect dialog now persists
  the last-used terminal type (xterm, VT220, VT100, xterm-256color)
- Cursor XOR artifacts on color systems — arrow key editing on System 7
  caused stale inverse highlights because CSI cursor movement didn't mark
  rows dirty. Now tracks cursor position changes and marks affected rows
- Disconnect screen preservation — screen buffer snapshotted on full
  clear (ESC[2J) and restored on disconnect, instead of wiping to blank
- Session not cleaned up on bookmark connect failure — now properly
  destroys session if TCP connect fails after window was created
- Replaced all `sprintf` with `snprintf` across 15 call sites
  (defense-in-depth buffer overflow protection)
- Added bounds check to TTYPE/TSPEED subnegotiation buffer in telnet.c

### Changed
- Glyph emoji base relocated from 0x60 to 0x80 to accommodate expanded
  primitive range (0x00-0x66)
- Lazy allocation of alt-screen and scrollback color arrays — deferred
  until first use, saving up to 38.5KB/session on System 7
- Screen snapshot moved from shared static to per-session Terminal struct
  for multi-session correctness; only triggers on full-screen clear
  instead of every data receive (~1.5ms/receive saved on 68000)
- Color default restore deferred to end of row instead of per-run,
  reducing redundant RGBForeColor/RGBBackColor traps by 10-15%
- Removed idle polling skip counter — eliminates 8.5ms average added
  latency on keystroke echo
- Single-session fast path in event loop — skips save/load state cycling
  when only one session is open
- Idle WaitNextEvent timeout reduced from 500ms to 167ms when disconnected
- SIZE resource increased from 640KB/512KB to 768KB/640KB for 4-session
  color headroom
- Removed ~450 lines of dead code: deleted dnr.c/dnr.h (superseded by
  dns.c), 14 unused functions, 4 unused defines, deduplicated
  ATTR_HAS_COLOR definition
- Build size: ~103KB (down from ~110KB after dead code removal)
- Memory per session: ~79KB System 6 mono, ~92KB System 7 color (initial),
  ~130KB fully loaded with alt screen and scrollback color

## [1.8.1] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed
- Add icon family resources (icl4, icl8, ics#, ics4, ics8) for System 7
  Finder compatibility — custom Flynn icon now displays correctly instead
  of generic application icon

## [1.8.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- System 7 improvements (all conditional, System 6 behavior unchanged):
  - MultiFinder suspend/resume: proper app4Evt handling, cursor blink stops
    when backgrounded, WaitNextEvent sleep increases to 60 ticks when suspended
  - Required Apple Events: kAEOpenApplication, kAEQuitApplication handlers
    for System 7 compliance (Finder can request clean quit)
  - StandardPutFile: modern System 7 save dialog for Save Contents, falls back
    to SFPutFile on System 6
  - Notification Manager: flashes Apple menu diamond when a session disconnects
    while Flynn is in the background
  - Machine type in About dialog: shows "Running on Macintosh Plus" (or SE,
    II, IIci, etc.) via Gestalt

### Changed
- About dialog simplified per Apple HIG: condensed to app name/version,
  machine type, copyright, and GitHub link

## [1.7.1] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- Save Contents... (Cmd+S): save terminal scrollback and screen buffer to a
  plain text file via SFPutFile dialog. Creates TEXT/ttxt files readable by
  TeachText. Default filename is the connection hostname.
- New savefile.c/savefile.h module for file save functionality

### Changed
- File menu reorganized per Apple HIG:
  - "Save Contents..." (Cmd+S) in its own section
  - "Bookmarks..." (Cmd+B) leads the bookmark section
  - Recent bookmarks listed under Bookmarks
  - "Add Bookmark..." (renamed from "Save as Bookmark...") moved after recents
  - Separators between file operations, save, and bookmark management
- Cmd+S reassigned from "Save as Bookmark" to "Save Contents" (standard HIG
  convention for Cmd+S = save to file)
- "Add Bookmark..." is now a dynamic menu item, enabling proper bookmark
  section grouping with Bookmarks... as the section leader

## [1.7.0] - 2026-03-10

### Changed
- Major codebase refactor: main.c reduced from 3,478 to ~494 lines (86% reduction)
- Extracted dialogs.c: all dialog handling (connect, bookmarks, about, disconnect)
- Extracted menus.c: menu management with per-menu dispatch handlers
- Extracted input.c: keyboard/mouse handling with data-driven key mapping tables
- Extracted clipboard.c: copy/paste/select all operations
- Extracted macutil.c: shared utilities (c2pstr, sprintfp, set_wtitlef, clear_window_bg)
- Extended session.c: font presets, ttype/font string helpers, window resize, init from prefs
- Collapsed identical telnet option handlers with fallthrough in telnet.c
- Extracted conn_resolve_host() from conn_connect() in connection.c
- Split handle_menu() into per-menu handlers (handle_file_menu, handle_edit_menu, etc.)
- Data-driven key mapping replaces if/else chain in handle_key_down()
- Total compiled LOC reduced from 12,027 to 10,036 (17% reduction)

### Fixed
- Remote disconnect preserves terminal screen content (was wiped by terminal_reset)
- Window repaint after disconnect alert restores terminal content in all modes

### Removed
- Dead conn_open_dialog() from connection.c
- 6 unused TCP wrapper functions from tcp.c (~256 lines)

## [1.6.1] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed
- MacTCP.h: add forward declarations for struct GetAddrParamBlock,
  ICMPParamBlock, TCPiopb, and UDPiopb to eliminate "declared inside
  parameter list" compiler warnings
- tcp.h: alias proc typedefs (TCPIOCompletionProc, TCPNotifyProc, etc.)
  to actual MacTCP UPP types instead of incompatible ProcPtr/re-declared
  function pointers, eliminating all -Wincompatible-pointer-types warnings
- MacTCP.h: convert from classic Mac CR to Unix LF line endings for
  consistent cross-platform source formatting

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- Edit > Select All (Cmd+A) to select entire terminal screen for copying
- Per-bookmark settings: username, terminal type, and font saved per bookmark
- Per-session font and terminal type: bookmark overrides apply only to that
  session; Options menu checkmarks reflect the active session
- Recent bookmarks in File menu (up to 5 most recently used)
- Save as Bookmark (Cmd+S): save current session as a bookmark, pre-filled
  from the active connection (host, port, username, font, terminal type)
- Auto-save bookmark settings: changing font or terminal type via Options
  menu automatically updates the originating bookmark
- Default button outlines on all dialogs per Apple HIG (3px FrameRoundRect)
- Cmd+. (Cancel) keyboard shortcut in all dialogs per Apple HIG
- Tab key cycles through edit fields in Connect and Edit Bookmark dialogs
- Connection progress window with status updates (Resolving, Connecting) and
  watch cursor during DNS/TCP operations
- Scrollback position indicator on right edge of terminal (rail + thumb)

- xterm-256color terminal type option
- Custom Finder icon for "Flynn Preferences" file (ICN# 129, FREF/BNDL)
- System 7 Preferences folder support: preferences stored in System Folder's
  Preferences folder on System 7+ (unchanged on System 6)

### Changed
- Startup optimization: Connect dialog appears in under 1 second (was 5-6s)
  by deferring MacTCP initialization to first connection attempt, deferring
  session/window creation until user clicks Connect, and reordering menu
  state updates after dialog
- Connection status window shows "Connecting to..." for IP addresses instead
  of "Resolving..." (DNS resolution is skipped for direct IPs)
- Options menu (renamed from Preferences; shorter, period-appropriate)
- Menu bar order: File, Edit, Options, Control, Window (Window at end per HIG)
- Control menu: Ctrl keys grouped alphabetically, then Break and Escape
- File > Close Session (Cmd+W) disconnects, destroys session, and closes
  window; closing last session keeps Flynn running (use Quit to exit)
- Window menu is now just the dynamic session list
- All error alerts use StopAlert, info alerts use NoteAlert per Apple HIG
- DNS timeout reduced from 15s to 5s per attempt for faster failure feedback
- Session windows cascade with 30px offset (was 20px)
- Remote disconnect shows "(disconnected)" in window title bar
- "Flynn Prefs" renamed to "Flynn Preferences" (matches Apple convention)
- Preferences I/O uses directory-aware PBH*Sync calls for System 7 compat

### Fixed
- MacTCP initialization failure now shows "MacTCP is not available" alert
  instead of silently failing
- Copy always grayed out in Edit menu (update_menus timing with MenuSelect)
- Cross-session copy/paste: selection state destroyed by idle loop cycling
- Selection auto-cleared within 17ms by incoming data, making copy nearly
  impossible on active connections
- Per-session font corruption when opening sessions with different fonts

### Security
- Telnet: reject unknown options before array indexing (prevents opts[-1]
  memory corruption from malicious servers)
- Telnet: track and discard overflowed SB subnegotiations
- Terminal: full UTF-8 validation (overlong, surrogates, invalid codepoints)
- Terminal: CSI parameter signed overflow check, SGR skip bounds checks
- Terminal: snprintf for DSR response, null-terminate OSC on all exit paths
- DNS: cap record counts to 64, limit compression pointer hops to 128
- Replace strcpy with strncpy+buflen in ttype/font string helpers
- snprintf in long2ip() to prevent buffer overrun
- Validate port range 1-65535 in connect dialog
- Validate DNS server IP on preferences load

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- Multiple simultaneous sessions (up to 4) in separate windows
  - Session struct bundles Window, Connection, TelnetState, Terminal per session
  - UIState save/load pattern for per-session cursor blink and text selection
  - Per-connection idle polling skip counter (moved from file-scope static)
- Window menu (MENU 133, between Edit and Preferences)
  - Close Window (Cmd+W) closes active session window
  - Dynamic window list with checkmark on active session
  - Clicking between windows switches active session
- File menu (renamed from "Session")
  - "New Session..." (Cmd+N, was "Connect...") — auto-creates new window if
    current session is already connected
  - "Close Session" (was "Disconnect") — disconnects active session
  - Bookmarks open in new session if current is connected
- Per-session event routing via window refCon
  - Mouse events routed via FindWindow → session_from_window
  - Key events routed to front window's session
  - Update/activate events routed via WindowPtr
- Font changes and dark mode toggle apply to all session windows
- Quit confirms if any session is connected, destroys all on exit
- Close box on individual windows closes just that session

### Changed
- Version: 1.1.1 → 1.5.0
- SIZE resource increased from 512KB/384KB to 640KB/512KB
- Memory per session: ~73KB (Terminal 52KB + Connection 12.5KB + TCP 8KB + misc)
- New source files: `session.c`, `session.h`
- Single-session performance overhead: ~100µs per idle tick (negligible)

## [1.1.1] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- 11 box-drawing primitive glyphs (U+2500-U+253C): ─│┌┐└┘├┤┬┴┼, drawn with edge-to-edge QuickDraw LineTo for seamless tiling
- 3 shade characters (U+2591-U+2593): ░▒▓, rendered with QuickDraw ltGray/gray/dkGray fill patterns

- Replace CRT-filtered screenshots with clean cropped captures
- Clean up documentation: remove redundant DEVLOG, trim README, consolidate screenshots
- Mark ROADMAP and AUDIT docs as historical

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- Unicode glyph rendering system (`glyphs.c`/`glyphs.h`)
  - 51 QuickDraw primitive glyphs: arrows, geometric shapes, block elements,
    card suits, musical notes, mathematical symbols, and more — drawn natively
    with LineTo, PaintRect, PaintOval, PaintPoly, and PaintArc
  - 15 monochrome 10x10 bitmap emoji rendered via CopyBits (2-cell wide):
    grinning face, heart eyes, thumbs up, fire, star, checkmark, crossmark,
    warning, lightning, sun, moon, skull, rocket, party popper, sparkles
  - Braille pattern rendering (U+2800-U+28FF) — 256 dot-grid patterns drawn
    as filled circles in a 2x4 grid per cell
  - Binary search codepoint-to-glyph lookup table for fast mapping
  - Bold variants: thicker lines (PenSize 2,1) and larger fills for primitives
  - U+00B7 middle dot rendered as centered PaintOval (was misrouted through
    Latin-1 Mac Roman table producing wrong character)

### Fixed
- Bold text spacing drift: DrawText() with bold TextFace increases advance
  width by 1px per character, causing cumulative rightward drift that consumed
  adjacent spaces. Replaced all DrawText calls with per-character
  MoveTo+DrawChar for absolute positioning (draw_row, draw_line_char fallback,
  draw_glyph_prim fallback)
- DCS parser content leak: ESC inside DCS string shared PARSE_OSC_ESC state,
  causing DCS content to leak as visible text. Added dedicated PARSE_DCS_ESC
  state
- CSI parameter overflow: TERM_MAX_PARAMS was 8, but truecolor SGR sequences
  (38;2;R;G;B foreground + 48;2;R;G;B background) need 12+ params. Increased
  to 16 with bounds checking
- CSI colon sub-parameter parsing for SGR 38:2:R:G:B truecolor sequences
  (colon-separated variant)
- UTF-8 error recovery: new start byte mid-sequence now resets decoder and
  reprocesses (was producing garbage output)
- Invisible Unicode characters (ZWSP, ZWJ, variation selectors, combining
  marks, BOM) now absorbed silently instead of rendering as '?'
- Unicode spaces (en space, em space, thin space, hair space) mapped to ASCII
  space instead of '?'

### Changed
- Version: 1.0.1 → 1.1.0
- Terminal parser expanded to 9 states (added PARSE_DCS_ESC)
- TERM_MAX_PARAMS: 8 → 16
- New source files: `glyphs.c`, `glyphs.h`
- Build size: ~110KB (up from ~98KB, glyph tables and bitmap data added)

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- TCP connect timeout enabled (commandTimeoutValue = 30 seconds)
  - Previously commented out, causing ~5 minute UI freeze when
    networking was unavailable (no command timeout = wait forever)

### Changed
- Verified compatibility with System 7.5.5 and Open Transport
- Updated README, About Flynn, and CHANGELOG to document
  System 7 / Open Transport support

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- Control menu with 6 items for sending control sequences without a
  physical Ctrl key:
  - Send Ctrl-C, Send Ctrl-D, Send Ctrl-Z, Send Escape, Send Ctrl-L,
    Send Break (Telnet IAC BRK)
  - Menu items enabled only when connected
  - MENU resource 132 added, MBAR updated to include it
- Keystroke buffering to prevent character loss during fast typing
  - Drains all pending key events from the Mac event queue before sending

    blocking from synchronous _TCPSend)
  - Single keystrokes still send immediately for interactive feel
  - key_send_buf[256] with buffer_key_send() and flush_key_send()

### Changed

  - Terminal buffer increased to 132x50 max (from 80x24)
  - Min window size: 20x5 cells
  - Grow icon drawn clipped (avoids scroll bar lines)
  - NAWS renegotiation sent on resize while connected
- Proportional font rendering
  - Detects proportional fonts (Chicago, Geneva) in `term_ui_set_font()`

  - Extracted `conn_connect()` from `conn_open_dialog()` for direct connect
- Font selection (Phase 12)
  - Settings menu (MENU 131) with Monaco 9 and Monaco 12 options
  - Runtime cell dimensions via `GetFontInfo()` measurement

- Screen not cleared on disconnect: `do_disconnect()` now calls
  `terminal_reset()`, `telnet_init()`, and redraws window
- Overlapping `strncpy` UB in `conn_connect()` when called from
  `conn_open_dialog()` — host parameter pointed to same buffer
- UTF-8 fallback character was Mac Roman 0xB7 (Σ sigma) instead of `?`

### Changed
- Version: 0.8.0 → 0.9.0

  - Inverse attribute renders white-on-black (PaintRect + patBic)
  - Unknown graphic characters fall back to regular text rendering
- TUI apps now display proper box-drawing borders (tmux, mc, dialog)

### Fixed

    cleanly instead of misinterpreted as blink/underline
- Additional SGR attribute mappings for monochrome
  - Dim (2) clears bold, italic (3) maps to underline, blink (5/6) maps to bold
  - Bright foreground (90-97) maps to bold
  - Reset codes: not-italic (23), blink-off (25)

### Changed
- Version: 0.6.1 → 0.7.0
- DA response identifies as VT220 (was VT100)
- 8-state parser (added PARSE_OSC, PARSE_OSC_ESC, PARSE_DCS)
- Terminal struct gains ~4KB for alternate screen buffer, charset state,
  DEC modes, OSC buffer, and window title fields
- Build size: ~78KB (up from ~70KB)

## [0.6.1] - 2026-03-06

### Changed
- Reduced WaitNextEvent timeout from 5 ticks (83ms) to 1 tick (17ms) for faster
  character echo and improved interactive responsiveness
- Replaced `memset(pb, 0, sizeof(*pb))` in `_TCPStatus()` with explicit field
  initialization, eliminating ~200 bytes of unnecessary zeroing per event loop
  iteration (matches wallops-146 reference pattern)
- Cached `sel.active` flag per row in `draw_row()`, avoiding 80 function calls
  to `term_ui_sel_contains()` per row when no selection is active
- Cached `TextFace()` value in `draw_row()` to skip redundant Toolbox calls
  for consecutive attribute runs with the same style
- Version: 0.6.0 → 0.6.1

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- Mouse-based text selection in terminal window
  - Click-and-drag to select text (stream selection, not rectangular)
  - Double-click to select word (contiguous non-space characters)
  - Shift-click to extend selection from cursor to click point
  - Selection renders as inverse video (XOR ATTR_INVERSE per cell)
  - Already-inverse cells render as normal when selected (double inversion)
  - Cursor blink suppressed during active selection
- Selection-aware copy (Cmd+C)
  - If text is selected: copies only selected text (partial first/last rows)
  - If no selection: copies entire visible 80x24 screen (existing behavior)
  - Trailing spaces trimmed per row, CR between rows
- Selection automatically cleared on keypress or incoming server data
- New functions in terminal_ui: Selection struct, 11 public API functions
- GetDblTime via low-memory global 0x02F0 (Retro68 compatibility)

### Changed
- Version: 0.5.1 → 0.6.0
- Build size: ~70KB (up from ~65KB)
- terminal_ui.c draw_row() now computes effective attributes per cell for selection overlay

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- Cmd+. sends Escape to remote host (classic Mac "Cancel" convention)
- Clear/NumLock key (vkey 0x47) sends Escape (available on M0110A keypad)
- charCode 0x1B fallback sends Escape from any source (USB/ADB keyboards)

### Fixed
- Escape key had no effect in Snow emulator — the M0110A keyboard has no
  physical Escape key, so Snow's `akm0110::translate` drops host Escape
  key events entirely. Cmd+. and Clear key now provide Escape functionality.
- Host Ctrl key had no effect in Snow — the M0110 has no physical Ctrl key.
  Option+letter (existing fix from 0.5.0) remains the correct way to send
  control characters on M0110/M0110A keyboards.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-05

  - Window title shows "[Scroll: -N]" indicator when scrolled back
  - New incoming data automatically returns to live view
  - `terminal_get_display_cell()` reads from scrollback ring buffer
- Copy/paste support via Mac clipboard (scrap)
  - Cmd+C copies visible 80x24 screen text (trailing spaces trimmed per row)
  - Cmd+V pastes clipboard text to connection in 256-byte chunks
  - Copy is scrollback-aware (uses display cells, not live screen)
- Proper About dialog (DLOG 130)
  - "Flynn", "Version 0.5.0", description, copyright, credits
  - Uses `GetNewDialog()`/`ModalDialog()`/`DisposeDialog()`
- Settings persistence (`settings.c`/`settings.h`)
  - `FlynnPrefs` struct saved to "Flynn Prefs" file (type 'pref', creator 'FLYN')
  - Host and port remembered across launches
  - Connect dialog pre-fills from saved preferences
- Option key as Ctrl modifier for M0110 keyboard
  - `optionKey` modifier bit mapped to control characters (`key & 0x1F`)
  - Fixes ESC and Ctrl+key on real M0110 keyboard (no physical Ctrl key)
- Quit confirmation alert when connected ("Disconnect and quit?")
- Connection lost notification alert when remote host closes connection
- Cursor visibility control (DECTCEM: ESC[?25h / ESC[?25l)
- Device Attribute response (DA: ESC[c → ESC[?1;2c, VT100 with AVO)
- Device Status Report response (DSR: ESC[6n → cursor position report, ESC[5n → OK)
- Generic ALRT 128 resource with OK/Cancel buttons for alerts

### Changed
- Version: 0.4.0 → 0.5.0
- New source files: `settings.c`, `settings.h`
- Resource file expanded with About dialog (DLOG/DITL 130) and alert (ALRT/DITL 128)
- Terminal struct gains `cursor_visible`, `response[]`, `response_len` fields

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- Dedicated terminal UI renderer (`terminal_ui.c`/`terminal_ui.h`)
  - Monaco 9pt font, 6×12 pixel character cells with 2px margins
  - Batched `DrawText()` calls scanning for attribute runs per row
  - Bold via `TextFace(bold)`, underline via `TextFace(underline)`
  - Inverse video via `PaintRect` + `srcBic` transfer mode
  - XOR block cursor with ~30-tick blink interval
  - Per-row dirty flags for efficient partial redraw
  - Direct drawing in null event handler (bypasses BeginUpdate/EndUpdate)
- Full keyboard input mapping in `handle_key_down()`
  - Arrow keys → VT100 escape sequences (`ESC[A`/`B`/`C`/`D`)
  - Home, End, Page Up, Page Down, Forward Delete
  - Delete/Backspace → DEL (0x7F), Return → CR (0x0D), Tab → HT (0x09)
  - Escape key (0x1B), Ctrl+key combinations
  - Cmd+key menu shortcuts preserved

### Fixed
- **Screen freeze after row 24 (critical)**: `_TCPStatus()` was the only
  TCP function missing `memset(pb, 0, sizeof(*pb))`. Stale parameter block
  data caused incorrect `amtUnreadData` reporting, which led `_TCPRcv()`
  (30-second blocking timeout) to hang the entire event loop after the
  terminal scrolled. Fixed by adding the memset and reducing the timeout
  to 1 second.
- Switched from `term_ui_invalidate()` (InvalRect → updateEvt) to direct
  `term_ui_draw()` calls in the null event handler for immediate rendering

### Changed
- Build size: 64KB (up from 61KB)
- All 14 test scenarios now pass (echo, arrow keys, Ctrl+C, nano, vi)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- Client-side Telnet protocol engine (`telnet.c`/`telnet.h`)
  - 9-state IAC parser with full option negotiation
  - ECHO, SGA, BINARY, TTYPE (VT100), NAWS (80x24), TSPEED (19200)
  - Adapted from subtext-596 server-side implementation (inverted for client)
- VT100 terminal emulation engine (`terminal.c`/`terminal.h`)
  - 80x24 screen buffer with 96-line scrollback ring buffer
  - Full cursor movement, screen/line clear, insert/delete, scroll regions
  - Text attributes: bold, underline, inverse
  - CSI parameter parser supporting up to 8 parameters
- Wired telnet and terminal into main event loop
  - Data flow: TCP → telnet_process → terminal_process → display
  - IAC responses automatically sent back to server
  - Basic Monaco 9pt text rendering in window

### Fixed
- Retro68 GCC 12.2.0 compatibility (MacTCP.h, API renames, missing headers)
- In-repo toolchain build (`build.sh`, Retro68-build/ gitignored)
- DLOG resource missing `noAutoCenter` field for Rez
